# FirstFlaskAPI

Greetings to anyone reading this, hope you're doing well. The title pretty much says it all. My coding experience with a object oriented language was previously limited to ruby. Mod 1 and 2 for any Flatiron School people out there (brings back memories, am I right?). I wanted to branch out and learn another programming language. I started learning python in December 2019 through a workshop at Microsoft Reactor New York. I had the pleasure of meeting Christopher Harrison that day who was the invited speaker. Microsoft Developer has a good python beginner resource via a Youtube video series and you can see Christopher there at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6. For people that like reading text instead of videos, the official python documentation, https://www.python.org/doc/versions/, has tutorials for each version as well. I'm going to be building a number of projects with python to get better versed with it. Some parallels I've drawn so far, Sinatra is to Flask whereas Ruby on Rails is to Django. Just an analogy in regards to the amount of stuff provided 'out-of-the-box'. Barring any other constraints, I want to learn flask first because there is less 'magic' so to speak. I'll be utilizing the documentation on flask provided by visual studio code, located here https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask, as an initial guide with some personal tweaks added later on.

First goal: set up and access a home page with a message on it

Second goal: hard code some data and try to access it via get request to specified route, in this case a small list of dictionary entries of starter pokemon

Third goal: access a specific pokemon via query paramter of id

Learned that use of virtual environments is considered best practice. Requirements.txt file will need to be created when ready to deploy to other computers.

Fourth goal: set up a basic template
