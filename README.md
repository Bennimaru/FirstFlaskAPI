# FirstFlaskAPI

Greetings to anyone reading this, hope you're doing well. The title pretty much says it all. My coding experience with a object oriented language was previously limited to ruby. Mod 1 and 2 for any Flatiron School people out there (brings back memories, am I right?). I wanted to branch out and learn another programming language. I started learning python in December 2019 through a workshop at Microsoft Reactor New York. I had the pleasure of meeting Christopher Harrison that day who was the invited speaker. Microsoft Developer has a good python beginner resource via a Youtube video series and you can see Christopher there at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6. I'm going to be building a number of projects with python to get better versed with it. Some parallels I've drawn so far, Sinatra is to Flask whereas Ruby on Rails is to Django. Just an analogy in regards to the amount of stuff provided 'out-of-the-box'. Barring any other constraints, learn flask first because there is less 'magic' so to speak.
